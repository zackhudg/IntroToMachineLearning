# IntroToMachineLearning

This code shows completed assignments for my Intro to Machine Learning class in the Spring of 2022.

These Jupyter Notebooks were provided by the professor, which were then added to by me and my groupmates using models, formulas, and practices discussed in lectures. This repository includes our two homework assignments, and our final collaborative project lives in Sam Anthony's repository, which can be found in my Stars > ContributedTo list, or at https://github.com/samantho/drug-prediction.
